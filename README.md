### SamPatt

I'm Sam Patterson, a software developer with more than 10 years of experience in tech startups and non-profits. I'm currently diving deep into fullstack development at the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive Bootcamp. 

I've always had one foot in the tech world - working on technology policy in DC, co-founding a tech company (as a non-technical founder!) - but I wanted to be building new things instead of writing about them. Now, I can build them alongside others - maybe you!

### ðŸ”­ **Projects I'm Proud Of**
  - [HaveWords.ai](https://github.com/SamPatt/HaveWords.ai): A p2p AI sharing site I built that allows users to join their friends and generate fiction/roleplay with an AI.
  - [pawzbe.com](https://github.com/SamPatt/pawzbe): A pet social media platform. Alongside two other great developers from my General Assembly software engineering bootcamp we built this MEN-stack app in only two weeks.
  - [Close Encounters of the Cute Kind](https://github.com/SamPatt/close-encounters-of-the-cute-kind): A game built in a week that blends classic maze navigation with a space theme, leveraging AI assets.

### ðŸŒ± **Currently Learning** 
I'm honing my skills in JavaScript, soon diving into Python. I'm well-versed with Git, GitHub, and Linux. I've also become friends with the OpenAI API recently - their DevDays announcements were exciting (DALL-E 3 API, hurray)!

### ðŸ‘¯ **Collaboration Interests** 
Amateur radio and decentralization projects. I have prior experience working on decentralization with [OpenBazaar](https://openbazaar.org/).

### ðŸ¤” **Beginner's Mind** 
I've been a 'hobbyist programmer' since I was a young teen, building text-based adventure games in GW-BASIC. I'm learning so much by immersing myself in programming as a profession.
  
### ðŸ’¬ **Ask Me About** 
Decentralization, AI, and my experiences with GPT-4. I love discussing AI best practices, prompting, and just generally being in awe of how far AI has come.

### âš¡ **Fun Facts**: 
  - Participated in the first HF radio transaction using Bitcoin (double nerd points!)
  - Hobbies include fencing, curling, table tennis, chess, macrophotography, and rock climbing.

Eager to continue my learning journey and collaborate on meaningful projects. Let's connect and build something cool together!
