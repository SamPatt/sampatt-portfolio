# Lifespan

*Lifespan: Why We Age—and Why We Don't Have To* by David A. Sinclair presents current research on aging and proposes interventions to extend healthy human life.

## Aging as Disease

Sinclair's central argument is that we should reconceptualize aging as a disease rather than an inevitable process. By framing aging this way, he suggests we can develop treatments that target its underlying mechanisms, potentially extending not just lifespan but healthspan—the period of life spent in good health.

## Scientific Research

The book provides an accessible overview of current aging research, explaining concepts like cellular senescence, epigenetic changes, and the role of sirtuins in aging. These explanations help readers understand the biological processes that drive aging at a cellular and molecular level.

## Speculative Elements

While the scientific background is valuable, some of Sinclair's specific recommendations about supplements and lifestyle interventions run ahead of established evidence. The author's personal anecdotes and practices are presented alongside more rigorous research, sometimes blurring the line between established science and speculation.
