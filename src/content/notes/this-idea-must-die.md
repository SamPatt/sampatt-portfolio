# This Idea Must Die

*This Idea Must Die: Scientific Theories That Are Blocking Progress*, also edited by John Brockman, collects essays from scientists arguing against established ideas they consider outdated.

## Critical Thinking

The premise of challenging scientific orthodoxy is valuable, encouraging readers to question established ideas rather than accepting them uncritically. At its best, the book promotes intellectual flexibility and openness to revising our understanding as new evidence emerges.

## Format Problems

Like its companion volume, this collection suffers from the short-essay format that prevents authors from developing thorough arguments. The brevity of each piece often results in assertions without sufficient supporting evidence, undermining the persuasiveness of the critiques.

## Tone Issues

Many essays display a strongly critical, sometimes dismissive tone toward opposing viewpoints. This approach, coupled with frequent signaling of the authors' ideological positions, can come across as self-congratulatory rather than genuinely thought-provoking. The emphasis on moral positioning sometimes overshadows the scientific arguments.
