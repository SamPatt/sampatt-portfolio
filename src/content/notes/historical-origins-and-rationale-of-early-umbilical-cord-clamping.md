# Historical Origins and Rationale of Early Umbilical Cord Clamping

Early clamping of the umbilical cord – defined as severing or tying the cord in the first moments after birth – was not always the standard practice in Western obstetrics. Across history, recommendations on when to clamp the cord have shifted dramatically. Below, we chronologically explore how **timing practices changed from antiquity to the modern era**, identify key figures and innovations that drove these changes, and examine the **major justifications** that have been offered for routine early cord clamping (and the evidence for or against those rationales). Primary historical sources (original treatises, studies, etc.) are cited separately from later analyses or commentary.

## Antiquity and Medieval Practices

In ancient and medieval times, midwives did **tie and cut the cord**, but there was **no specific emphasis on immediate clamping**. The main concern was simply to prevent bleeding. **Soranus of Ephesus** (2nd century AD), a Greco-Roman physician, advised that the newborn’s cord be tied in two places and cut in between – this avoided hemorrhage from both the infant and the mother’s side [neonatology.net](https://neonatology.net/classics/mj1980/ch27.html#:~:text=cord%20be%20cut%20in%20the,or%20wine%20on%20the%20infant). This shows early understanding that the cord vessels needed ligation, but Soranus did **not mention any precise timing** relative to the placenta’s delivery. Similarly, medieval obstetric texts like the 12th-century **Trotula** compendium gave detailed instructions for cutting the cord (even suggesting a prayer or charm to recite and tying it with a special string), yet **made no comment about how soon to do it**[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3423128/#:~:text=postulated%20its%20role%20in%20fetal,is%20made%20in%20these%20texts). In essence, **waiting for the placenta to be delivered before attending to the cord was the norm** both by default and out of practical necessity in traditional births.

Historical and anthropological evidence suggests that in most pre-modern and non-Western settings, the cord was typically **left alone until after the afterbirth**. For example, 20th-century observers of indigenous African births noted that it was considered “completely wrong to touch the cord until the whole placenta is expelled”[journals.co.za](https://journals.co.za/doi/pdf/10.10520/AJA20785135_44431#:~:text=The%20most%20primitive%20of%20the,1%29%20will%20remain). The mother would remain in a birthing position, and the placenta would be delivered by natural effort or gravity, only **then** would the cord be tied off and cut[journals.co.za](https://journals.co.za/doi/pdf/10.10520/AJA20785135_44431#:~:text=The%20most%20primitive%20of%20the,1%29%20will%20remain). This hands-off, physiological third stage (allowing the neonate to stay attached to the placenta until expulsion) was likely common in earlier eras as well. **In summary, antiquity and medieval sources show cord tying was standard to prevent bleeding, but there was no directive to clamp immediately** – early clamping as we think of it had not yet emerged as a distinct intervention.

## 17th Century: Earliest Advocacy of Immediate Cord Cutting

The practice of **clamping and cutting the cord _before_ placental delivery** first gained traction in the mid-17th century. A pivotal figure was the French obstetrician **François Mauriceau**, whose 1668 obstetrics treatise marks one of the earliest clear endorsements of early cord intervention. Mauriceau recommended that after the baby was born, **the cord should be immediately knotted and cut**, and the birth attendant should promptly “relieve” the mother of the placenta[journals.co.za](https://journals.co.za/doi/pdf/10.10520/AJA20785135_44431#:~:text=Why%20Was%20the%20Cord%20ever,to%20keep%20the%20uterus%20up). He feared that if one waited too long, **the uterus might contract and “close” before the placenta was out**, leading to a trapped (retained) placenta[journals.co.za](https://journals.co.za/doi/pdf/10.10520/AJA20785135_44431#:~:text=Why%20Was%20the%20Cord%20ever,to%20keep%20the%20uterus%20up). To prevent this, he advised wrapping the cord around the hand and gently pulling as soon as the child was delivered, while using the other hand to stabilize the uterus – effectively an early form of **controlled cord traction**[journals.co.za](https://journals.co.za/doi/pdf/10.10520/AJA20785135_44431#:~:text=rule%20%28Vardi%29,or%20inversion%20of%20the%20uterus). Mauriceau did caution against excessive force (acknowledging that yanking could snap the cord and cause a dangerous retained placenta or even uterine inversion)[journals.co.za](https://journals.co.za/doi/pdf/10.10520/AJA20785135_44431#:~:text=2%20or%203%20times%20around,contrac%02tion%20of%20the%20uterus%20and). Nonetheless, his teaching represents a shift to an **active management of the third stage**: intervening immediately to extract the placenta, with the cord being clamped/ligated early as part of that maneuver.

Mauriceau’s influence (and that of other contemporary male “man-midwives”) made early cord cutting **increasingly routine by the late 1600s】[journals.co.za](https://journals.co.za/doi/pdf/10.10520/AJA20785135_44431#:~:text=Why%20Was%20the%20Cord%20ever,to%20keep%20the%20uterus%20up). Notably, this was a departure from the practices of traditional midwives. Historians have observed that the 17th century saw the rise of male obstetric practitioners in Europe, whose approaches sometimes differed from the conservative, wait-and-see methods of midwives. In this case, the male physicians’ inclination to **actively manage delivery of the placenta** led to cord clamping “before the placenta dropped,” a practice **not clearly documented before the 1600s**[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1bc6rt/did_our_ancestors_clamp_and_cut_and_tie_the/#:~:text=2,we%20do%20today%2C%20but%20they). Some commentators have even speculated that beyond medical reasoning (like Mauriceau’s fear of hemorrhage), male practitioners may have been motivated by impatience or discomfort with waiting for the afterbirth to deliver spontaneously[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1bc6rt/did_our_ancestors_clamp_and_cut_and_tie_the/#:~:text=exclusively%20western,we%20do%20today%2C%20but%20they). In any event, by 1700 the idea of **immediate cord tying and rapid placental delivery had entered obstetric doctrine**, laying the groundwork for early clamping to become common.

## 18th Century: Debate and Dissenting Voices

During the 1700s, early cord clamping became more widespread in Western obstetric practice – **but it was not without controversy**. Even as many practitioners adopted the new habit of cutting the cord right after birth, others began to question it. Several **prominent figures in the late 18th century argued that hastily clamping the cord was actually harmful to the newborn**, and they advocated for a more delayed approach.

One early critic was **Dr. Charles White** of Manchester, who in 1773 strongly condemned the routine immediate cutting of the cord. He wrote that “the common method of tying and cutting the navel string in the instant the child is born… has nothing to plead in its favour but custom”[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3423128/#:~:text=However%2C%20the%20practice%20quickly%20became,31%20His%20theory%20was%20verified). White classed early cord cutting as an “error in practice” sustained purely by tradition, implying there was no scientific or medical justification for it besides habit. Instead, he favored waiting and allowing nature to take its course.

Around the same time, **Erasmus Darwin** (physician and grandfather of Charles Darwin) joined the fray with an even more emphatic recommendation to delay. In **1801**, Erasmus Darwin admonished in his book _Zoonomia_ that cutting the cord too soon was “very injurious to the child” and urged that the cord not be tied or cut **“till the child has not only repeatedly breathed but till all pulsation in the cord ceases.”** Only then, he argued, would the baby receive the full benefit of the placental blood; otherwise the child would be “much weaker than it ought to be”[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3423128/#:~:text=nothing%20to%20plead%20in%20its,clamped%20neonate.10). This remarkably prescient advice shows that some 18th-century practitioners recognized the importance of placental transfusion (i.e. the newborn continuing to get blood from the placenta for a short time after birth). Darwin’s view was essentially that of “delayed” cord clamping, over 200 years ahead of its time.

It’s important to note that White and Darwin were speaking out **precisely because early clamping _had_ become common practice by the late 18th century**. Their writings indicate that many midwives and doctors of the era were, in fact, cutting the cord immediately upon birth as a routine – so much so that these men felt the need to publicly challenge the practice. Darwin even attempted to provide evidence: he cited the observation that infants allowed to continue pulsation were stronger, and this was later supported by crude experiments. In **1875, Dr. Pierre Budin** measured the residual blood volume in delivered placentas when cords were clamped early, and found about _92 cubic centimeters_ of blood remained in the placenta – blood that would otherwise have circulated to the infant[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3423128/#:~:text=the%20navel%20string%20too%20soon%3B,clamped%20neonate.%2029). This was a significant quantity, roughly on the order of 80–100 mL, and Budin concluded that the early-clamped neonate was effectively denied that amount of blood. His findings gave concrete, quantitative support to what Erasmus Darwin had intuited decades before.

Despite such warnings, **the mainstream obstetric community was slow to embrace delayed clamping**. Early cord tying/cutting continued to **“plead custom” as its main justification through the 18th and into the 19th century**, even as a minority of voices argued for a more physiological approach[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3423128/#:~:text=However%2C%20the%20practice%20quickly%20became,who%2C%20in%201875%2C%20measured%20the)[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3423128/#:~:text=From%201773%20onwards%2C%20maternity%20practitioners,These%20questions%20may). The stage was set for ongoing debate in the century that followed.

## 19th Century: Technological Advances and Entrenchment of Early Clamping

By the 1800s, **cord clamping was commonly undertaken in Europe and America**, but there remained considerable debate over _how quickly_ it should be done. Obstetric textbooks of the 19th century show variability: some recommended tying the cord only after pulsations stopped, while others endorsed immediate severance. This era also saw **technological developments – such as the invention of dedicated cord clamps – and new hypotheses that influenced cord management**.

On the technology front, obstetricians historically used a simple ligature (a thread or tape) to tie off the cord. In **1899, Dr. E. Magennis** introduced a metal **“midwifery surgical clamp”** as an alternative to the cloth ligature[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3423128/#:~:text=Nevertheless%2C%20cord%20clamping%20grew%20in,its%20application%20is%20rarely%20noted). Magennis argued that an **instrumental clamp would reduce the risk of infection**, since it could be sterile, unlike possibly unclean ligature materials[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3423128/#:~:text=Nevertheless%2C%20cord%20clamping%20grew%20in,its%20application%20is%20rarely%20noted). His clamp design was adopted widely, and from that point on, the **cord clamp became a universal tool** in delivery rooms. (Magennis himself still advised that the clamp be applied only **“when it has ceased to pulsate,”** reflecting that at least in 1899 some practitioners were nominally waiting for pulsation to end before clamping[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3423128/#:~:text=Nevertheless%2C%20cord%20clamping%20grew%20in,its%20application%20is%20rarely%20noted). However, in actual practice the exact timing often went unremarked.)

Different obstetric schools promoted different timing. For example, some 19th-century practitioners took the approach of **tying/clamping only the baby’s side of the cord and _not_ immediately tying the placental side**, thus allowing some blood to drain from the placenta after birth. The American obstetrician **William Potts Dewees** (circa 1820s) was cited by a later author as suggesting that _“the evacuation from the open extremity of the cord will yield 2 or 3 ounces of blood, which favours contraction of the uterus and expulsion of the placenta.”_[journals.co.za](https://journals.co.za/doi/pdf/10.10520/AJA20785135_44431#:~:text=might%20break%20off%2C%20resulting%20in,is%20found%20in%20the%20book) In other words, **letting the placental end bleed a bit was thought to help the uterus clamp down and the placenta detach**. Accordingly, some doctors in the early 1800s would place a ligature on the fetal side to protect the baby from hemorrhage, but leave the maternal side open or only clamp it after a delay. This practice was essentially the opposite of trying to transfuse blood _to_ the baby – instead, it was intentionally draining blood _from_ the uterine side, a form of induced placental blood-letting intended to prevent hemorrhage and hasten placental delivery. There was, however, no consensus; others feared that not tying the cord on both sides could pose infection risks or make a mess. By late century, **many practitioners began routinely clamping the cord in two places (both near the infant and near the placenta)** as standard, partly to avoid any blood spilling on the bed when the cord was cut[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3423128/#:~:text=employed%20to%20avoid%20blood%20loss,%E2%80%98not%20sufficient%20to%20justify%E2%80%A6%20clamping%E2%80%99). This was one rationale given for double clamping: to **“spare the bed linen”** by preventing placental blood from gushing out of the cut end[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3423128/#:~:text=employed%20to%20avoid%20blood%20loss,%E2%80%98not%20sufficient%20to%20justify%E2%80%A6%20clamping%E2%80%99). Another rationale was that if the placental end was clamped, once the placenta detached the cord would **visibly lengthen** (since one clamp would move outward), providing a signal that it was time to pull out the placenta[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3423128/#:~:text=employed%20to%20avoid%20blood%20loss,%E2%80%98not%20sufficient%20to%20justify%E2%80%A6%20clamping%E2%80%99). These 19th-century justifications were largely about **hygiene and convenience**, not infant health.

By **1861**, practices still varied greatly according to an early edition of _Williams’ Obstetrics_. Some doctors would attempt to deliver the placenta immediately by cord traction or manual removal, while others waited. James Matthews Duncan and others wrote extensively on the third stage in the mid-1800s, reflecting ongoing debate. Toward the end of the century, however, **active management was increasingly taught as the proper method** for trained obstetricians. The general trend was toward more intervention: give ergot (a uterotonic) to the mother, clamp and cut the cord promptly, and deliver the placenta under gentle traction.

It’s important to note that although early cord clamping had become **entrenched as routine by the late 19th century**, some leading obstetricians remained aware of the infant’s need for placental blood. The French physician **Pierre Budin** (mentioned earlier) presented his experiment in 1875 quantifying neonatal blood loss with early clamping[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3423128/#:~:text=the%20navel%20string%20too%20soon%3B,clamped%20neonate.%2029). And in the 1880s, **Dr. J. H. Aveling** and others advocated “autotransfusion” of the baby by delaying cord cutting when possible, especially if an infant was weak or asphyxiated at birth. Obstetric texts around 1900 sometimes noted that a baby would pink up better if the cord was not cut too soon. For instance, **J. Whitridge Williams** (author of the influential _Williams Obstetrics_) initially favored late cord tying, citing Budin’s 92 mL blood volume finding and reasoning that the infant draws in that blood with its first breaths[journals.co.za](https://journals.co.za/doi/pdf/10.10520/AJA20785135_44431#:~:text=Williams%27%20says%20that%20up%20to,Accor). In Williams’ 1st edition (1903) and several early editions, the recommendation was to wait ~1–2 minutes for the baby to begin breathing, unless there was a need to rush. This shows that **the value of delayed clamping was recognized by some experts even as routine hospital practice was trending toward immediate clamping**.

By the close of the 19th century, **cord clamping/cutting was universally practiced in some form (no one advocated leaving the cord uncut indefinitely in medical settings), but the exact timing still lacked standardization**. The invention of the hemostatic clamp and the rise of antiseptic technique had made the mechanics of cord cutting easier and cleaner – a far cry from the days of tying cords with a string from a lute (as Trotula suggested). Yet, as obstetrics entered the 20th century, the stage was set for early clamping to **solidify into a doctrine**, driven by new medical theories and institutional protocols.

## Early–Mid 20th Century: Medicalization and the Dominance of Early Clamping

In the 20th century, obstetric practice moved definitively into hospitals and under physician management. This period saw **early cord clamping become the dominant, standard practice in Western obstetrics**, to the point that delayed cord clamping was largely viewed as an antiquated or “slow” approach until late in the century. Several developments and beliefs during the early-mid 1900s contributed to this dominance:

- **Blood Transfusion and “Blood Banking” (1930s):** In **1938**, physicians discovered that **placental/umbilical cord blood could serve as a useful source for human blood transfusion**[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3423128/#:~:text=One%20reason%2C%20perhaps%2C%20that%20clamping,used%20ever%20since%2C%20for%20conditions). A. H. Goodall published in _JAMA_ about this “new source of blood for transfusion”[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3423128/#:~:text=,in%20Anesthesia%20and%20Analgesia%201953%3B260%E2%80%937). Given the interest in securing blood supplies (especially around World War II), obstetric protocols in some hospitals began clamping and cutting the cord early so that the placental blood could be collected in a sterile container. This meant intentionally foregoing the infant’s placental transfusion in order to use the blood for others. The practice wasn’t universal, but it introduced a **systematic reason to clamp early: to harvest cord blood**. (This is an early antecedent of today’s cord blood banking – see below.)
    
- **Emergence of **Rh Factor Theory (1940s):** Research into **erythroblastosis fetalis** (hemolytic disease of the newborn caused by Rh blood group incompatibility) peaked in the 1940s. It was hypothesized that clamping the cord immediately could **prevent exchange of blood between mother and baby at birth**, thereby reducing the infant’s exposure to maternal antibodies[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3423128/#:~:text=In%20the%201940s%2C%20work%20into,time%20the%20practice%20was%20routine). At the time, doctors observed that some Rh-negative mothers had severe isoimmunization after birth and their babies were affected. Although we now know maternal–fetal hemorrhage mostly happens before or during delivery (not after), it was believed then that keeping the placenta circulation brief might help. **Early cord clamping became recommended in cases of Rh incompatibility** as a preventive measure[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3423128/#:~:text=In%20the%201940s%2C%20work%20into,time%20the%20practice%20was%20routine). This rationale persisted into the 1950s, until the development of Rh immune globulin prophylaxis in the 1960s rendered it unnecessary[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3423128/#:~:text=In%20the%201940s%2C%20work%20into,time%20the%20practice%20was%20routine). (With RhIg available, it no longer mattered how long the cord bled, since mothers could be treated to avoid antibody formation. But by then early clamping was already routine habit in most deliveries.)
    
- **Obstetric Anesthesia and Newborn Resuscitation:** The mid-20th century saw **heavy use of obstetric anesthesia and analgesia**, from ether/chloroform in earlier decades to narcotics and “Twilight Sleep.” These drugs often **depressed newborns at birth**, meaning babies didn’t breathe spontaneously right away. Pediatricians began attending deliveries to perform immediate care on limp infants. In this context, cutting the cord immediately was seen as necessary so the baby could be taken to a warming table for resuscitation. In fact, the editor of _Williams Obstetrics_ (10th ed., 1950) noted that although it was ideal to delay clamping, in practice **neonatal apnea, need for airway suctioning, or simply the expediency of moving the infant and repairing the mother’s perineum often dictated early clamping**[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3423128/#:~:text=completing%20the%20procedure,20). Thus, **“convenience” became a cited reason**: obstetricians wanted the baby off the field to suture an episiotomy, and pediatric staff wanted the baby on their own table to assess breathing[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3423128/#:~:text=Especially%20before%20the%20advent%20of,20). This led to immediate cord clamping being built into the workflow of hospital deliveries.
    
- **Virginia Apgar and Newborn Assessment:** In **1953**, Dr. Virginia Apgar introduced the **Apgar score**, a 1-minute (and 5-minute) evaluation of newborn vitality. Notably, Apgar’s seminal study explicitly **excluded cases of “natural childbirth” where the cord was not immediately clamped**[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3423128/#:~:text=The%20assessment%20of%20neonates%20is,that%20keeping%20the%20cord%20intact). In her methodology, all babies were assessed _after_ being separated from the placenta. She even remarked that keeping the cord intact longer was part of a “slow delivery” style not practiced in the cases studied[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3423128/#:~:text=sentiment%20is%20echoed%20in%20the,delaying%20is%20unwise%20or%20unnatural). The very image of mid-20th-century obstetrics became one of the baby being briskly clamped, cut free, and held by the obstetrician or pediatrician at one minute for evaluation **(see image)**.
