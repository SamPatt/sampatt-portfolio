## Abstract
Importance: While several studies have assessed the impact of COVID-19 vaccination on short-term mortality, none have compared long-term mortality by vaccination status, particularly in young individuals who are less likely to experience severe disease following SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Objective: To compare 4-year all-cause mortality in individuals aged 18 to 59 years vaccinated with the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine vs unvaccinated individuals.

## Key Findings
- Vaccinated individuals had a 74% lower risk of death from severe COVID-19 (weighted hazard ratio [wHR], 0.26 [95% CI, 0.22-0.30]).
- Vaccinated individuals had a 25% lower risk of all-cause mortality (wHR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.75-0.76]), with a similar association observed when excluding severe COVID-19 death.
- Sensitivity analysis revealed that vaccinated individuals consistently had a lower risk of death, regardless of the cause; mortality was 29% lower within 6 months following COVID-19 vaccination (relative incidence, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.69-0.73]).

## Notes
- This study is a cohort study utilizing the French National Health Data System and focused on individuals aged 18 to 59 years as of November 1, 2021.
- Participants were categorized based on having received a first mRNA vaccine dose between May 1 and October 31, 2021, or being unvaccinated by November 1, 2021.
- The median follow-up period was 45 months, with vaccinated individuals commonly being older and having more cardiometabolic comorbidities.
- The study supports the long-term safety of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, as there was no increased risk of 4-year all-cause mortality among vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals.
