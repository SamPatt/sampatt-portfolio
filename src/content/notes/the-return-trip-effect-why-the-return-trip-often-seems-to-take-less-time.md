## Abstract
Three studies confirm the existence of the return trip effect: The return trip often seems shorter than the initial trip, even though the distance traveled and the actual time spent traveling are identical. A pretest shows that people indeed experience a return trip effect regularly, and the effect was found on a bus trip (Study 1), a bicycle trip (Study 2), and when participants watched a video of someone else traveling (Study 3). The return trip effect also existed when another, equidistant route was taken on the return trip, showing that it is not familiarity with the route that causes this effect. Rather, it seems that a violation of expectations causes this effect.

## Key Findings
- The return trip effect is not due to increased familiarity with the route, as it also occurs on different but equidistant return routes.
- The effect is likely due to a violation of expectations; initial trips take longer than expected, leading to adjusted expectations for the return trip that are not met.
- Manipulating expectations can eliminate the return trip effect, suggesting the role of expectations in shaping perceptions of trip duration.

## Notes
- A pretest showed that participants frequently experience the return trip effect, with the return trip often feeling shorter than the initial trip.
- Study 1 involved participants returning from trips to a housekeeping fair or a theme park by bus. Results showed that the return trip felt shorter despite constant actual travel time.
- Study 2 replicated the findings in a field experiment, using bicyclists who returned either by the same or different routes, further proving that familiarity was not a factor.
- Study 3 used a controlled setting where participants watched identical video-trips, confirming that the return trip effect persisted even when visual cues were consistent. The manipulation of initial expectations showed that the effect could be diminished when expectations for a lengthy initial trip were set.
- The expectation violation hypothesis aligns with findings that people have inaccurate time predictions and tends to recognize tasks as taking longer or shorter based on previous experiences.
- The findings allow for further research into how repeated tasks and expectations shape time perception, suggesting implications for everyday activities.
