Our individual and societal beliefs and habits about learning are often wrong. The [[illusion of competence]] is commonplace. Reading without trying to recall is the default practice, even though it's extremely inefficient. Almost no one even knows about [[Spaced Repetition Learning]].

This book tries to change that, explaining the science behind learning. It explains both the good science as well as the bad (but unfortunately commonplace) science and beliefs too.

Worth reading if you want to understand the subject.
