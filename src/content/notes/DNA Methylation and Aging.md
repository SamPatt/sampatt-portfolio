DNA starts almost identical in every cell, but methyl groups quickly attach to different genes in different patterns. This methylation process determines which genes can receive signals to activate.

Methylation continues throughout life, reflecting our experiences and choices. Smoking, exercise, stress, nutrition, parenting, illness, and pollution all influence methylation patterns.

Our epigenome essentially functions as our body's diary, with tiny molecular doodles on our DNA recording what we've been doing with ourselves.

Aging affects methylation more than anything else. Methylation patterns differ distinctly between infancy, childhood, adulthood, and old age. Many longevity researchers believe these methylation changes don't just record aging but actually drive it, suggesting our evolving epigenome may be responsible for aging itself.
