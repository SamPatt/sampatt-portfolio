The user uploaded two street view images and asked me to guess the location without using web search. From initial inspection, it seems like a coastal road, possibly in Ireland or the UK. The road features a solid white centerline and what looks like yellow dashed lines on the shoulders, which may be typical in Ireland. Iâ€™ll focus on these details and try to narrow it down further by analyzing other visual clues in the images.

The dashed yellow lines in the images resemble Irish rural roads where yellow lines often mark the hard shoulder. However, the dashed segments in the images suggest a possible difference in the road type. In the UK, there are double yellow lines used for no parking, but these are along curbs rather than the center. Additionally, in the images, the camera is positioned in the middle of the lane, with the dashed lines on the right side. Let me take a closer look at the images to confirm.

The images show stacked limestone stone walls and a rocky, karst landscape, which reminds me of The Burren in County Clare, Ireland. The road appears to be along the coast, possibly near Galway Bay, and the scenery fits the R477, a scenic coastal road that hugs the coastline around Black Head. The images match the landscape with limestone hills to the right and a low stone seawall on the left. While R559 in Dingle is another option, the rocky features of the R477 seem to fit better.

The images show a dashed yellow line on the right side of the road, which is unusual for Irish roads since they drive on the left. Yellow dashed lines in Ireland are typically on the left edge, marking the hard shoulder. Given the Google car's position, it seems to be on the opposite side of the road, traveling in the opposite direction. The centerline reflects a solid white line, further suggesting this reversed orientation. The parked Renault, partly across the centerline in the second image, adds support to this interpretation.
