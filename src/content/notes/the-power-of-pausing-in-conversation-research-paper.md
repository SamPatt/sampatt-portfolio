## Abstract
Speakers often pause by taking brief breaks between words and utterances. While both conventional wisdom and prior research suggest that frequent pausing generates negative impressions, this work has almost exclusively focused on monologues. In contrast, we suggest that in the context of conversations, pausing more frequently can actually benefit speakers. Specifically, pausing encourages verbal assents from conversation partners (e.g., "yeah" or "uhhuh"), which lead them to perceive speakers more positively. A multi-method study of synchronous collaborative conversations, including an analysis of hundreds of customer service calls and two experiments manipulating a focal speaker's pause frequency, supports this account. Although pausing frequently can have impression management drawbacks in monologues, our findings indicate that, in conversation, it can make speakers seem more helpful.

## Key Findings
- Pausing more frequently in conversations can lead to positive perceptions of the speaker.
- Verbal assents from conversation partners, such as "yeah" or "uhhuh", are encouraged by frequent pausing.
- While pausing may be detrimental in monologues, it benefits perception in conversational contexts.

## Notes
- The study combines analysis of customer service calls and controlled experiments.
- The research suggests a shift in understanding the role of pausing, emphasizing its potential advantages in interactive dialogues.
- The findings challenge traditional views that associate pausing primarily with negative impressions.
