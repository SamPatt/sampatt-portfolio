# Longitude

*Longitude: The True Story of a Lone Genius Who Solved the Greatest Scientific Problem of His Time* by Dava Sobel tells the captivating story of how humanity overcame the challenge of determining longitude at sea.

## Critical Problem

Navigation was incredibly dangerous in the past, largely because sailors couldn't accurately determine longitude while at sea. This limitation led to countless shipwrecks and lost lives, making the solution to this problem one of the great scientific quests of the 18th century.

## Competing Approaches

The book details the competition between astronomical methods championed by academic scientists and the mechanical chronometer approach developed by John Harrison, a self-educated clockmaker. This struggle reveals much about the scientific establishment, politics, and the nature of innovation.

## Human Story

Beyond the technical aspects, Sobel crafts a compelling narrative about Harrison's persistence in the face of institutional obstacles. His decades-long effort to create precise marine chronometers, and the resistance he faced from the scientific establishment, makes for a dramatic human story intertwined with scientific advancement.
