This is an academic book and is occasionally dry, but Tainter's coverage of the topic is excellent and he put forward a compelling argument.

He's especially dismissive of the many hand-wavy arguments about "moral collapse" or other mystical ideas, but doesn't totally disregard culture either.

If you're curious why complex societies collapse, read this book.
