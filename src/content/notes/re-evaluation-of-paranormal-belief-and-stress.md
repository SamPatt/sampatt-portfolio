## Abstract
Recent research indicates that paranormal belief, in the absence of allied cognitive-perceptual and psychopathology-related factors, is not associated with negative wellbeing outcomes. However, investigators have historically reported relationships between specific facets of belief (e.g., superstition) and stress vulnerability. These typically derive from the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale (RPBS), which has questionable psychometric integrity. The main issue being that several RPBS items perform poorly. Noting this, the present paper re-examined the relationship between paranormal belief and stress using the Rasch purified version of the RPBS. This comprises two dimensions, called Traditional Paranormal Belief (TPB) and New Age Philosophy (NAP). These are operationalised in terms of function. Specifically, whether belief provides a sense of control at the social (TPB) or individual level (NAP). Accordingly, this study examined whether TPB and NAP were differentially predictive of levels of perceived stress. In this context, stress served as an indicator of well-being. A sample of 3084 participants (Mage = 50.31, SD = 15.20, range 18â€“91) completed the RPBS alongside the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10). Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling revealed that TPB was significantly predictive of higher Distress, and lower Coping. NAP was neither predictive of Distress nor Coping. These findings support the notion that TPB is attendant with external control, particularly the notion that unknown supernatural forces/powers influence existence.

## Key Findings
- TPB was significantly predictive of higher Distress and lower Coping.
- NAP was not predictive of Distress or Coping.
- The study suggests TPB is associated with external control, particularly involving supernatural influences.

## Notes
- The study utilized the Rasch purified version of the RPBS, focusing on dimensions: Traditional Paranormal Belief (TPB) and New Age Philosophy (NAP).
- Paranormal belief was examined in terms of providing control at social (TPB) or individual levels (NAP).
- The sample consisted of 3084 participants with a mean age of 50.31 years.
