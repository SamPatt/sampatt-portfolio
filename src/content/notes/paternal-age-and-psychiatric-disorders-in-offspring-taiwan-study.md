## Abstract
Although paternal age has been linked to certain psychiatric disorders, the nature of any causal relationship remains elusive. Here, we aimed to comprehensively assess the magnitude of a wide range of offspring’s psychiatric risk conferred by paternal age, leveraging a pedigree inferred from covered-insurance relationship (accuracy >98%) in Taiwan’s single-payer compulsory insurance program. We also examined whether there is an independent role of paternal age and explored the potential effect of parental age difference. A total cohort of 7,264,788 individuals born between 1980 and 2018 were included; 5,572,232 with sibling(s) were selected for sibling-comparison analyses and 1,368,942 and 1,044,420 children with information of paternal-grandparents and maternal-grandparents, respectively, were selected for multi-generation analyses. Using inpatient/outpatient claims data (1997–2018), we identified schizophrenia, autism, bipolar disorder (BPD), attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), major depressive disorder (MDD), eating disorder (ED), substance use disorder (SUD), mental retardation (MR), tic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), anxiety, and somatoform disorder. We identified suicides using death certificates. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the paternal/maternal/grand-paternal age association with psychiatric risk in the offspring. The total cohort and sibling-comparison cohort resulted in similar estimates. Paternal age had a U-shaped relationship with offspring’s MDD, ED, SUD, and anxiety. A very young maternal age (<20 years) was associated with markedly higher risk in offspring’s SUD, MR, and suicide. Older paternal age (>25 years) was linearly associated with offspring’s schizophrenia, autism, BPD, ADHD, MDD, ED, SUD, MR, OCD, anxiety, and suicide. Older grand-paternal age was linearly associated with offspring’s schizophrenia, autism, ADHD, and MR. Dissimilar parental age was positively associated with offspring’s ADHD, MDD, SUD, MR, anxiety, and suicide, and negatively associated with offspring’s OCD. This comprehensive assessment provides solid evidence for the independent role of paternal age in psychiatric risk in the offspring and clarifies the significance of both early parenthood and delayed paternity.

## Key Findings
- Paternal age is independently associated with a range of psychiatric disorders in offspring.
- A U-shaped relationship between paternal age and offspring risk for MDD, ED, SUD, and anxiety was observed.
- Older paternal and grand-paternal age increase the risk of disorders such as schizophrenia, autism, and MR in offspring.

## Notes
- This study utilized a large cohort from Taiwan, assessing 7,264,788 individuals.
- The analysis included sibling-comparison and multi-generation assessments.
- Data were sourced from a comprehensive insurance program, with high accuracy in the pedigree information.
- Consideration was given to the effects of both very young maternal age and dissimilar parental ages.
