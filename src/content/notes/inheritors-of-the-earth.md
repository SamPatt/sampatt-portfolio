# Inheritors of the Earth

*Inheritors of the Earth: How Nature Is Thriving in an Age of Extinction* by Chris D. Thomas challenges current narratives about humankind causing mass extinctions.

## Rethinking Biodiversity

This nuanced book explores biological systems in aggregate, over time. A key insight is that human timescales are vastly different from the timescales of earth's biology, leading us to overestimate human impact in some ways.

## Challenging Conventional Wisdom

The author makes some surprising claims, such as dismissing the concept of invasive species as incoherent. He convincingly argues that biological diversity has actually increased in many contexts, that mass extinction is not occurring as commonly perceived, and that human activity is in some ways increasing biological diversity.

## Conservation Approach

Thomas doesn't advocate abandoning environmental protection. Instead, he discusses what has and hasn't worked in protecting biological diversity, offering a more nuanced view of human-nature interactions that avoids both alarmism and complacency.
