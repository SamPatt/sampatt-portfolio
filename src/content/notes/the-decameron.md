# The Decameron

*The Decameron* by Giovanni Boccaccio is a 14th-century collection of 100 novellas told by a group of ten young people sheltering from the Black Death in a villa outside Florence.

## Surprising Modernity

Despite being written over 650 years ago, the stories in *The Decameron* remain remarkably accessible and engaging to modern readers. The humor, social observations, and insights into human nature transcend the centuries, revealing aspects of the human condition that have changed little since medieval times.

## Diverse Stories

The collection presents a wide range of tales spanning from bawdy comedies to romantic adventures to moral parables. This variety keeps the reading experience fresh and provides a multifaceted view of medieval Italian society, from nobles and clergy to merchants and peasants.

## Historical Window

Beyond their entertainment value, the stories offer valuable insights into the social norms, power structures, and daily life of 14th century Italy. Boccaccio's detailed descriptions of customs, relationships, and moral attitudes provide a vivid picture of a society on the cusp between medieval and Renaissance worldviews.
