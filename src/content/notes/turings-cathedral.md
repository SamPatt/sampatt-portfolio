# Turing's Cathedral

*Turing's Cathedral: The Origins of the Digital Universe* by George Dyson chronicles the birth of modern computing in the post-war era.

## Focus on von Neumann

Despite the title's reference to Alan Turing, the book primarily focuses on John von Neumann and the team at Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study who built one of the first modern computers. This shift in focus provides insight into the practical implementation of theoretical ideas about computing.

## Historical Context

Dyson meticulously establishes the historical context surrounding the development of early computers. He examines the impact of World War II, the institutional environment at Princeton, and the interconnected web of brilliant mathematicians and engineers who collaborated on this revolutionary technology.

## Technical Detail

The book doesn't shy away from technical details about the engineering and mathematical challenges involved in creating the first computers. While occasionally overwhelming with contextual information, this thoroughness creates a comprehensive account of how modern computing emerged from a specific time, place, and group of individuals.
