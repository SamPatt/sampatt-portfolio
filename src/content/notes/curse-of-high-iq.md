Discussing high intelligence is difficult, for many reasons. 

Some of the reasons are due to the problems of defining the term, determining how applicable it is to the subject at hand (or life in general), and the other practical concerns of talking about a complex subject.

But some of the reasons are social. It's a tricky subject to talk about.

Clarey's approach is to not bother being polite and say whatever he wants about the subject. This could be refreshing and allow for a relatable connection with the audience, but all too often it tips into condescending, arrogant and even bitter.

He's not wrong about many of the claims, but they are put forward in unappealing ways. This book falls into the category of 'cope for underachievers.'

I wouldn't recommend this book to a high-IQ young person, the ideas aren't helpful even if some are true.
