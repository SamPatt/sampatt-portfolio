# Fig. 7: The probability of men and women being within 5 m of a campmate as a function of distance from home.

> The plot displays estimates from model 7. The lines and shaded areas represent the mean and ±1 s.e.m., respectively. The sociality sample includes 193,244 recordings of location and proximity by 178 individuals (85 male, 93 female) across 172 days of observation. The model estimates that when 2 km from camp, women had a 0.77 probability (s.e.m. = 0.05) of being near a campmate, and men had a much lower probability of 0.07 (s.e.m. = 0.02). When much farther from camp, at 12 km, these probabilities are 0.99 (s.e.m. = 0.01) for women and 0.06 (s.e.m. = 0.02) for men.

_I find this fascinating. The low probabilities for men, in general, and also how stable they are. And the high probabilities for women, in general. Women in these societies are literally almost never alone!_
