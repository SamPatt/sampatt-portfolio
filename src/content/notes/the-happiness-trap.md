# The Happiness Trap

*The Happiness Trap: How to Stop Struggling and Start Living* by Russ Harris provides an accessible introduction to Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT).

## Counterintuitive Approach

The central idea is paradoxical but powerful: intentionally seeking happiness often leads to more suffering. Harris argues that our cultural obsession with positive thinking and feeling good actually creates a "happiness trap" that increases psychological distress.

## Acceptance over Avoidance

The book emphasizes accepting difficult thoughts and feelings rather than fighting or avoiding them. This mindfulness-based approach helps readers develop psychological flexibility and reduce the impact of negative emotions without trying to eliminate them.

## Values-Based Living

Beyond acceptance, Harris guides readers toward identifying their core values and taking committed action aligned with those values. This focus on meaningful living rather than feeling good provides a more sustainable path to wellbeing than the pursuit of happiness itself.
