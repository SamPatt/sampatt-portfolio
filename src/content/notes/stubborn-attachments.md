# Stubborn Attachments

Tyler Cowen's book is part of what touched off a new focus on progress studies. It's quite short and much more accessible than most books written by economists. The book is as much about ethics as it is economics, with the central focus on growth.

## Key Arguments

Cowen makes the case that we must place a much higher emphasis on growth than we currently do. He argues that economic growth, properly understood, is not just about material prosperity but about enabling human flourishing in all its forms.

## My Thoughts

I don't fully agree with Cowen on the details, but it's an interesting and thought-provoking read, and makes a compelling case that we should be unabashedly striving for economic growth.
