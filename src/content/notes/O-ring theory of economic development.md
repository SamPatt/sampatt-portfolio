The O-ring theory of economic development is a model of economic development put forward by Michael Kremer in 1993, which proposes that tasks of production must be executed proficiently together in order for any of them to be of high value. The key feature of this model is positive assortative matching, whereby people with similar skill levels work together.

The model argues that the O-ring development theory explains why rich countries produce more complicated products, have larger firms and much higher worker productivity than poor countries.

The name is a reference to the 1986 Challenger shuttle disaster, a catastrophe caused by the failure of O-rings. 

> This paper proposes a production function describing processes subject to mistakes in any of several tasks. It shows that high-skill workers—those who make few mistakes—will be matched together in equilibrium, and that wages and output will rise steeply in skill. The model is consistent with large income differences between countries, the predominance of small firms in poor countries, and the positive correlation between the wages of workers in different occupations within enterprises. Imperfect observability of skill leads to imperfect matching and thus to spillovers, strategic complementarity, and multiple equilibria in education.

> I have written about this paper before [here](https://nicholasdecker.substack.com/p/the-o-ring-theory-of-economic-development); Kevin Bryan wrote an exegesis [here](https://afinetheorem.wordpress.com/2011/05/21/the-o-ring-theory-of-economic-development-m-kremer-1993/) as well. I think about it every single day, and there is probably no paper which has influenced me more. It raises and answers so many questions.

> - What would happen if production required multiple steps, an error in any of which destroys the whole product? Error rate would have a non-linear impact on income, and so we can explain the differences in income between countries as a function of skill. 
>     
> - Why should we expect immigration to increase human capital in the less skilled country? Because it also implies multiple possible equilibria of skill attainment, most of which are sub-optimal. Allowing immigration changes people’s expectation of what they can earn, and so causes them to invest more into human capital, even if they don’t end up moving, as I [wrote about before.](https://nicholasdecker.substack.com/p/brain-drain-is-probably-just-totally)

> - Where should we expect raw materials to be made? And where are the finished goods made? In the poor countries and in the rich countries, respectively.

> - Where will the highest skilled workers be? With the other high skilled workers, regardless of job. We should expect the best paralegals to be paired with the best lawyers, and so on.

> In the original paper, Kremer includes a fair bit of formal modeling of these ideas. Don’t be intimidated if you cannot understand it. He is simply restating his propositions in the language of mathematics. If you can understand the logic behind them, you understand them, whether or not you can read the notation. This happens a lot in economics. As a novice, if you can’t understand the notation, do not slog through it! You will simply waste your time. You’ll pick it up eventually, but for now, read for the ideas.
