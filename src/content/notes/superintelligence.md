Bostrom is considered one of the best researchers on this subject, and it's clear he's spent a lot of time thinking about this.

I made it about halfway through the book, and I began losing interest. It felt overly speculative and philosophical.

It is worth reading if you want to understand some of the terminology used by the AI safety people.
