# Enlightenment Now

Steven Pinker's book is truly excellent. Similar to Matt Ridley's *The Rational Optimist*, but with far more data and interesting discussion on institutional changes in recent centuries.

## Key Points

The overall premise is that the world has gotten drastically better - based on nearly every measurable metric - in recent centuries, and this progress should be understood, celebrated, and continued. The progress is attributed to many different factors, but the embrace of enlightenment ideals is a large factor, ideals which Pinker wants us to continue upholding.

## Data-Driven Approach

The book includes exhaustive charts and data on a wide range of areas. No fair-minded person would conclude that the world hasn't improved in a multitude of ways after reading this book.
