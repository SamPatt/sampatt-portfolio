The user shared two images from Google Street View, asking me to identify the location. The first image shows a small town, with European-style houses, cracked asphalt, and mountains in the background. There's a tower with a conical roof, possibly a mosque minaret, but in the second image, it seems more like a church bell tower. I also notice Cyrillic text on a sign and a utility pole, which might nod toward the Balkans, especially Bulgaria or a neighboring region. I'll consider this when figuring out the location.

The license plates are blurred, but I can still spot some shapes. The architecture suggests a southeastern European style, with stone base houses, plaster upper halves, and tile roofs. This looks typical for places like Bulgaria, North Macedonia, or Serbia. In Bulgarian towns, church towers with small arches are often prominent in central plazas. To further confirm, I'll zoom in on the images and inspect the sign more closely. Let's focus on cropping around the sign region to get a better view.

In the first image, there's a sign in the bottom left that looks like an octagonal STOP sign, but the back side is visible, not the front, so I can't fully make it out. Off in the distance, I see a golden spire, possibly belonging to a mosque minaret — this could point to a mosque in Bulgaria, where there are Muslim communities like Turkish Bulgarians. This might suggest a location in southwestern Bulgaria. Next, I'll look at the second image for more clues.

The building in the center-left of the background looks like a clock tower or a church bell tower, with four pillars on top, which reminds me of Bulgarian church architecture. The small sign on the utility pole possibly says "СТОП", which translates to "STOP" in Cyrillic; interestingly, "STOP" in Bulgarian uses Latin letters but sometimes encounters Cyrillic in use. It might refer to overhead wires. I’ll zoom in and inspect it more closely for confirmation.

The top of the sign looks like it says "МЕТОХА" or "METOHA," and maybe the number 3 is below it. "МЕТOХА" could be Bulgarian, as "МЕТОХ" means 'monastery estate' or 'metoch.' It could also be Greek, since their alphabet has similar characters. The sign seems to be a street direction sign, possibly with an arrow pointing left. I should crop the image further to get a better look at the left side and confirm that arrow.

The sign suggests "МЕТОХА," which could be a Bulgarian or Serbian term, potentially for a district or road. The nearby houses have a Bulgarian Revival architecture, which is common in areas like Koprivshtitsa, Bansko, or Smolyan, within the Rhodope Mountains. The 2021 Street View watermark also points to Bulgaria. Based on the church tower and architecture, I'm narrowing it down to towns like Zlatograd, Smolyan, Chepelare, or Bansko. I need to double-check whether there is a "Metoha" district near Bansko or Tryavna.

"Metoha" might be a district in Koprivshtitsa, though it’s unclear. I can think of small Bulgarian towns like Dospat, Rudozem, Smolyan, or Devin. The golden minaret in the first image suggests a mosque, hinting at a population of Bulgarian Muslims. However, the second image seems to show an Orthodox church or maybe a clock tower,with no visible cross. The tower has small windows and four pillars on top, so I’ll need to zoom in to clarify.

The tower in the image looks like a typical Orthodox church bell tower with an onion dome, which suggests this town has both a mosque and a church, likely in Southeastern Bulgaria. The sign "МЕТОХА" could refer to a district, possibly a bus stop. Smolyan doesn't have a "Metoha" quarter, but Zlatograd might. The buildings in the background follow the Bulgarian National Revival style, typical of towns like Koprivshtitsa and Bansko. I wonder if Bansko has a "Metoha" district.

In Bansko, there may be a local area called "Metoha" or a holy site nearby. Bansko’s St. Trinity bell tower, built in 1850, has a square base and a pointed, pyramid-shaped spire with arches. However, the tower in the image has an onion dome shape and possibly a cross on top. The road seems smaller, which might suggest it’s a side street. I’ll need to check the minaret in the first image for more clues.

The second image shows cobblestone paving, which is typical of many Bulgarian towns. I also notice a building with a blue sign that might be from the Bulgarian Post, based on the colors (blue and yellow). These could be useful details when trying to narrow down the specific town. Taking a closer look at these hints might help confirm the location, so I’ll zoom in for more details.

From the minaret’s golden roof and slender shape, it seems we’re dealing with a town that likely has both a mosque and an Orthodox church, possibly in a Pomak region in the Rhodope mountains. The sign "МЕТОХА 3" could point to a "Metoha" neighborhood. Zlatograd comes to mind with its "Metokha" viewpoint, but I'm uncertain. The bell tower's four columns supporting an onion-shaped dome are reminiscent of the Church of St. Nicholas. I’ll hold off on further searching for now and continue analyzing based on available details.

The blue sign above the door could be from a bank, maybe DSK Bank, though I can't make it out clearly. It could also be "Postbank" since they use blue colors. The small yellow sign might be the Bulgarian Post logo. In Bulgaria, I remember that the mailboxes for posting letters are typically yellow, but this one is blue. That's a little puzzling, but I’ll zoom in to get a clearer look and see if I can confirm any details.

The yellow sign might be typical of Bulgarian Post, which fits with the clues I have so far. Based on these, it seems likely the town is in Bulgaria — possibly Zlatograd, which is near the Greek border in the Rhodope mountains. Zlatograd has distinct architecture with white houses and dark beams, and the clock tower there is made of stone with a wooden top. I'm trying to recall if Zlatograd’s area "Metokha" could be relevant, but Bansko might have a "Metoha" area too. The houses in the pictures look a bit different, so I'll keep analyzing.

The Trinity tower differs from the one I was thinking of, so it's not Bansko — its tower has an octagonal spire. The town might have a smaller mosque, fitting with towns like Zlatograd or Chepelare, which both feature Christian and Muslim communities. The sign "МЕТОХА 3" could point to a smaller hamlet, Metoha, 3 km away, making Zlatograd a strong candidate. After considering images and geographical clues, I'd propose that the town is Zlatograd, Smolyan Province, Bulgaria.
