# What I Talk About When I Talk About Running

Haruki Murakami's memoir offers a window into his thoughts on running, writing, and the disciplined life of a novelist.

## Introspective Style

The author presents his inner monologue in a remarkably candid way, sharing his thoughts with a degree of self-reflection that borders on self-indulgence but never crosses the line. This creates an intimate connection with readers, who feel they're accompanying Murakami on both physical and mental journeys.

## Running as Metaphor

While ostensibly about running, the book uses this physical practice as a lens through which to examine broader themes of discipline, aging, creativity, and purpose. Murakami draws insightful parallels between the solitary, committed practice of running and the similar demands of writing novels.

## On Self-Discipline

Murakami offers straightforward advice about self-discipline and maintaining long-term habits, presented in a humble and practical manner. His approach to consistent daily practice, whether in running or writing, provides valuable insights for anyone pursuing challenging long-term goals.
