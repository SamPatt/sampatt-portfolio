The most common mechanism of change for spaced repetition learning tasks is called _retrieval practice._ In brief: when you attempt to recall some knowledge from memory, the act of retrieval tends to reinforce those memories. [^1]

The learning produced by retrieval is called the “testing effect” because it occurs when you explicitly test yourself, reaching within to recall some knowledge from the tangle of your mind. Such tests look like typical school exams, but in some sense they’re the opposite: retrieval practice is about testing your knowledge to _produce_ learning, rather than to assess learning.
