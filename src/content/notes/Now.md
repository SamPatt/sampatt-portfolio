This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about), inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/).

## Current Focus

- Living in West Michigan
- Homeschooling two of my children
- Looking for work as a fullstack developer / technical writer / developer relations
- Reading as [much as I can](/notes) and [writing as much as I can](/blog)
- Training to reach Champion division in Geoguessr
- Training to run a half-marathon
- Building a [bunch of fun stuff](/projects), particularly focused on self-hosted LLMs
- [Staying fit](/blog/2025-02-20-fitness-nerd) and improving my lifts
- Playing table tennis in my local league
## Recent Updates

- I benched 225 lbs - this took me about 18 months to achieve so I was glad to reach it
- I got [runner-up](/blog/2025-03-03-unc-unclearning) in the 2024 Interintellect essay writing contest
- I competed in my first table tennis tournament in late March (South Bend), winning 5 out of 6 matches - I got my first official rating at 1123
- Reached Master I level in Geoguessr (only one division left!)
- My [o3 and Geoguessr article](/blog/2025-04-28-can-o3-beat-a-geoguessr-master) made it to the top of Hacker News and Tyler posted about it on Marginal Revolution
## What's Next
