## Abstract
The paper examines the literacy levels of college English majors and evaluates their ability to comprehend complex texts like Charles Dickens' "Bleak House." Using the PIAAC scale, it reveals that a significant number of college students are "functionally illiterate" for academic environments. The study highlights the discrepancy between students' perceived reading abilities and their actual performance on complex literary passages.

## Key Findings
- Only 12% of US adults score at literacy level 4 or higher, which is necessary to comprehend lengthy and complex texts.
- 58% of college English majors couldn't understand sufficient portions of "Bleak House" to read it independently.
- 5% of students were able to accurately understand and interpret all seven paragraphs of the novel. 

## Notes
- A majority of English majors in the study believe they can read complex novels, but cannot understand basic figurative language.
- The subjects used dictionaries and phones but still struggled to comprehend the text due to cognitive overload.
- Despite being literature majors, the inability to distinguish between figurative and literal language was common among students.
- The study questions the assumption that college students develop these skills on their own while taking literary analysis courses.
- Authors suggest that if literacy levels are ignored, diplomas may be given to students without the necessary literacy skills for professional success.
