# Algorithms to Live By

*Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions* by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths applies computational thinking to everyday human problems.

## Practical Applications

The book takes algorithms developed for computers and shows how they can provide insights into human decision-making. From organizing your closet to deciding when to stop apartment hunting, the authors demonstrate how computational approaches can help optimize everyday choices.

## Interdisciplinary Approach

By bridging computer science, psychology, and philosophy, the book creates fascinating connections between seemingly disparate fields. This cross-disciplinary perspective reveals how similar problems appear across different domains and how solutions in one area can inform approaches in another.

## Technical but Accessible

While the material can be challenging, particularly for readers without a background in computer science or mathematics, the authors make a concerted effort to present complex ideas in accessible terms. The concepts are most clearly understood when read carefully rather than listened to as an audiobook, allowing readers to process the logical steps at their own pace.
