I really like this book until about 2/3 of the way in, when he began interviewing someone who is trying to implement some of the ideas of the book in his business, and some of the claims seemed a bit handwavy to me. I stopped reading eventually.

The history part of it was good. The modern stuff seems a bit of a stretch.
