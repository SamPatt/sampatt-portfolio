# Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!

I've seen Feynman's memoir recommended many times, and I now understand why. Feynman is an excellent storyteller, and his fascinating life contains much humor and cleverness (and more than a dash of mischief).

## Beyond Physics

This memoir isn't limited to Feynman's contributions to the Manhattan project, or physics in general. It goes deeply into many different aspects of his life - from picking locks at Los Alamos, to playing in Brazilian samba bands, to his adventures in art and biology.

## Intellectual Curiosity

What makes this book special is how it portrays Feynman's relentless curiosity and playful approach to problem-solving. His method of understanding the world by breaking problems down to first principles and questioning everything is inspirational, whether applied to scientific puzzles or everyday situations.
