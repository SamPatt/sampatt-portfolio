# Permanent Record

*Permanent Record* is Edward Snowden's autobiographical account of his life and the events that led him to expose the NSA's mass surveillance programs.

## Personal Journey

Beyond the typical narrative about government surveillance that most people are familiar with, the book provides a deeply personal look at Snowden's childhood, formative experiences, and moral development. His stories about growing up during the early internet era resonate with a sense of nostalgia.

## Ethical Dilemma

The book details Snowden's internal struggle as he discovered the extent of surveillance being conducted by intelligence agencies. It offers insight into the thought process that led to his decision to become a whistleblower, despite the enormous personal cost.

## Privacy and Democracy

While the ideological discussions may be familiar to those who have followed Snowden's public statements, the book places these ideas in the context of his personal experiences, making the abstract concepts of privacy and government overreach more concrete and relatable.
