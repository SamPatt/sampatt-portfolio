Ridley has published several excellent books. [[the-red-queen]], [[the-rational-optimist]] are some of my favorites.

This is an informative book, and Ridley goes to great pains to tell a history of humanity through each of our chromosomes. He doesn't quite pull it off. But if you're interested in genetics of the history of early humans, it's definitely worth your time.
