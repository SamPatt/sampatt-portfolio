## Abstract
All cells in organisms ranging from yeast to humans utilize iron as a cofactor or structural element of proteins that function in diverse and critical cellular functions. However, deregulation of the homeostatic mechanisms regulating iron metabolism resulting in a reduction or excess of iron within the cell or outside of it can have serious effects to the health of cells and the organism. This review provides a brief overview of the molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating iron physiology, including the molecules and processes regulating iron uptake, its storage and utilization, its recycling, and its release from the cell, such that the cellular iron levels are sufficient to meet metabolic demand but below those that cause permanent damage. The major focus of the review is on the pathological consequences of dysregulation of these homeostatic mechanisms, focusing on the brain. Current advances on the role of iron accumulation to the pathogenesis of rare neurological disorders caused by genetic mutations as well as to the more prevalent and age-associated neurodegenerative diseases are described.

## Key Findings
- Deregulation of iron metabolism can lead to critical health issues in both cellular and systemic levels.
- Molecular and cellular mechanisms are crucial in maintaining iron homeostasis, including its uptake, storage, utilization, recycling, and release.
- Accumulation of iron is linked to the pathogenesis of both rare genetic neurological disorders and prevalent age-associated neurodegenerative diseases.

## Notes
- The paper emphasizes the importance of iron regulation for cellular health.
- It reviews the complex processes and molecules involved in maintaining iron balance within cells.
- Focuses on how excessive iron accumulation contributes specifically to brain-related degenerative diseases.
