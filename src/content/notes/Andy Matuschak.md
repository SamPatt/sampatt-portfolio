Clever independent researcher who writes about and creates tools for thought.

His essay [Why Books Don't Work](https://andymatuschak.org/books/) was one of the reasons I started a more serious method for note taking / flashcards.

I read his essay [How to write good prompts](https://andymatuschak.org/prompts/) to improve my flashcards.
