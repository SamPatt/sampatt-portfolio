# More from Less

Andrew McAfee did a good job titling *More from Less: The Surprising Story of How We Learned to Prosper Using Fewer Resourcesâ€•and What Happens Next*. This story is surprising indeed!

## Key Insight

The basic premise is that wealthy nations have already moved past *peak stuff*. In other words, though they continue to get wealthier, they are able to do this while consuming fewer natural resources. Fewer resources *total*, not just per capita! Fewer natural resources means less of an impact on the environment.

## Counter-Intuitive Finding

This seems so counter-intuitive it's hard to grasp at first. The more economic activity, the *less* consumption of natural resources? Yes. The book proves this is actually happening, and then explains why. The implications are hard to over-state. Protection of the environment hinges on *increasing* wealth, not limiting it.
