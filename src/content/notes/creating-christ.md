This is an interesting book. Is it compelling? Not really.

There are elements of the conventional story of Christ that the authors challenge in compelling ways, but their alternative theory doesn't seem much more plausible.

They also heavily focus on iconography in ways that seemed reaching.

If you're specifically interested in unique theories about the history of Christianity, Judaism, or this era of the Roman empire, then it's worth a read. Otherwise, skip.
