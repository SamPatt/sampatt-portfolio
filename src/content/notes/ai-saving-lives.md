# AI Saving Lives: The Case of Joseph Coates

In March 2025, an inspiring story was shared by The New York Times about how an artificial intelligence model led to a lifesaving breakthrough for Joseph Coates, a patient diagnosed with a rare blood disorder called POEMS syndrome.

## The AI-Driven Breakthrough

Joseph Coates was informed by his doctors that there was little hope for recovery, given his condition. His symptoms included numbness, an enlarged heart, and kidney failure. Standard treatments like stem cell transplants were deemed too risky. In a turn of fate, Dr. David Fajgenbaum, a physician reached out by Coates' girlfriend, utilized an AI model to suggest a novel drug regimen that involved chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and steroids, a combination previously untested for Coates' condition.

## Implementation and Results

The AI-driven suggestion led to a rapid response in Coates' health, eventually enabling him to undergo a successful stem cell transplant. Within four months, Coates was in remission.

## AI in Drug Repurposing

This success is part of a broader movement where scientists leverage AI to identify potential new uses for existing medications, known as drug repurposing. Unlike traditional drug discovery, which is time-consuming and costly, AI accelerates the process by efficiently sifting through vast datasets to connect diseases with possible treatments.

### Noteworthy Examples

- **Minoxidil:** Initially a blood pressure medication, now treats hair loss.
- **Viagra:** Originally intended for cardiac issues, repurposed for erectile dysfunction.
- **Sirolimus:** Used by Dr. Fajgenbaum himself to keep his Castleman disease in remission.

## The Global Impact of AI in Healthcare

Efforts akin to Dr. Fajgenbaum's are ongoing internationally, with projects at institutions like Penn State, Stanford, and various universities in Japan and China. These initiatives aim to uncover overlooked connections between existing medications and rare conditions.

### Challenges and Opportunities

While there are regulatory and economic hurdles, such as limited financial incentives due to expired drug patents, the potential health benefits drive continued investment and interest. Projects like Every Cure, founded by Dr. Fajgenbaum, have attracted funding from entities like TEDâ€™s Audacious Project, highlighting the societal impact of this AI application.

## Conclusion

The story of Joseph Coates underscores the transformative potential of using artificial intelligence in medical research and treatment. By discovering untapped therapeutic possibilities within existing drugs, AI not only promises hope for patients like Coates but also catalyzes a paradigm shift in how we approach rare diseases and healthcare innovation.
