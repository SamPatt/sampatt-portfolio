# This Idea Is Brilliant

*This Idea Is Brilliant: Lost, Overlooked, and Underappreciated Scientific Concepts Everyone Should Know* is a collection of short essays from scientists and thinkers edited by John Brockman.

## Diverse Perspectives

The book brings together many prominent intellectuals to highlight scientific concepts they believe deserve more attention. This approach creates a diverse sampling of ideas from different disciplines, potentially exposing readers to concepts they might not otherwise encounter.

## Format Limitations

The collection's main weakness lies in its format. With each concept receiving only a few pages, the presentations often feel superficial, providing just enough information to introduce an idea but not enough to develop it meaningfully. This brevity limits the book's educational value.

## Starting Point

Rather than offering comprehensive explanations, the book functions better as a catalog of interesting concepts that readers might want to explore further. The table of contents itself may be the most valuable part, serving as a jumping-off point for deeper investigation into specific ideas that catch the reader's interest.
