I've heard this has become a seminal text on psychedelics in a short time, and I understand why. Pollan talks to a lot of people, in depth, and gives us an excellent picture of this subject. He's open about a slight bias in favor of psychedelics, but it seems fairly even-handed. I knew a fair bit about this subject already and I learned from this book.
