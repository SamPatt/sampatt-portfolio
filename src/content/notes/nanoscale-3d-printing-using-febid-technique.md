## Abstract
Focused electron beam–induced deposition (FEBID) is a 3D nanoprinting technique capable of producing intricate metal-based nanostructures with exceptional design flexibility. All that’s needed are a conventional scanning electron microscope (SEM) and a continuous source of gaseous precursor molecules, typically metal–organic compounds. In the SEM, the molecules spread out over the surface of the fabrication substrate, and those in the focus of the electron beam become dissociated. Although volatile fragments quickly dissipate, nonvolatile components, including the metal constituents, will stick. A stationary SEM beam will make a vertical pillar of deposits, and a slowly moving beam will generate a sloped one. By controlling the motion of the beam and the angle of the substrate, one can create a vast array of complex 3D nanostructures with features as small as 10 nm. The technique, which can be applied to arbitrarily shaped substrates, has diverse applications in nano-optics, nanomagnetism, scanning probe microscopy, particle trapping, and more.

## Key Findings
- FEBID allows for the creation of intricate metal-based nanostructures with high design flexibility.
- A stationary SEM beam can create vertical pillars, while a moving beam can generate sloped structures.
- FEBID has diverse applications, including in nano-optics, nanomagnetism, and scanning probe microscopy.

## Notes
- Example of application: A SEM image shows an atomic force microscope (AFM) cantilever with its tip hovering over a 2-µm-tall platinum structure inspired by the Louvre Pyramid. This was constructed using a mesh of 100 nm nanowires printed with FEBID.
- The AFM probe acts as a sensitive force sensor, aiding in the analysis of the mechanical properties of such nanostructures.
- The referenced work (A. Alipour et al., 2023) supports these findings and demonstrates practical applications of this 3D nanoprinting technique.
