This may be one of the most controversial books that I've never heard anyone else mention before.

Don't draw too many conclusions just based on the title alone. He puts a lot of thought into his ideas, and it's important to understand his definitions. 

This was originally written in the late 60s, and during this time there was still widespread involuntary commitment into mental institutions.

This changed how I view mental illness. Not because I completely agree with his argument - in fact I'm still not sure I 100% understand it - but because it's the type of book which makes you consider thoughts that hadn't occurred to you.

Does mental illness or psychiatry interest you? Read it.
