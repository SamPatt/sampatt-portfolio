## Abstract
Small business owners play a central role in all advanced economies. Nonetheless, they are an understudied occupational group politically, particularly compared to groups that represent smaller portions of the population (e.g., union members, manufacturing workers). We conduct a detailed investigation of the politics of small business owners and offer new insight into the evolving role of education, class, and occupation in electoral politics. Leveraging diverse sources of data – representative surveys from around the world, campaign finance records, voter files, and a first-of-its-kind, bespoke survey of small business owners – we find consistent evidence that small business owners are more likely to identify with and vote for right-wing parties. We find that this tendency cannot be fully explained by factors that cause people to select into being small business owners. Rather, we identify a key operational channel: the experience of being a small business owner leads people to adopt conservative views on government regulation.

## Key Findings
- Small business owners are more likely to identify with and vote for right-wing parties.
- This political inclination is not entirely due to pre-existing factors that influence individuals to become small business owners.
- The experience of being a small business owner leads to the adoption of conservative views on government regulation.

## Notes
This study uses a combination of global representative surveys, campaign finance records, voter files, and an innovative survey of small business owners to draw its conclusions. The research underscores the political significance of small business owners and explores the influence of occupation on political attitudes and behaviors.
