description: In Which I Make a Cool Script

As I was writing about the Zonos TTS, I took a screenshot of the interface, then realized I didn't have a method for displaying it in my post.

I did a lot of blogging a long time ago, but it's been a while - what's the best way to display an image file, anyway?

Claude gave me several recommendations. One was Cloudinary, which I have used before, but it's proprietary and I'd rather go open source when I can. It also recommended a unique hack:

```
3. GitHub Issues "hack" (Super simple):

- Open a new issue in any repo
- Drag & drop or paste screenshot
- GitHub generates a permanent CDN URL
- Copy URL, close issue without saving
- Use URL in your markdown
```

Who says AI can't be creative?

It also recommended [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/), which I've never heard about. It's a free CDN for open source projects. Sweet.

In my local directory for code repos, I creatively created a new repo, changed into it, then made it a git repo:
```
mkdir media
cd media
git init
```
